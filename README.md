# coding-multimodal-rlhf

Objective and Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project was to enhance AI models by refining their ability to process and understand coding-related multimodal inputs using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Traditional AI models often struggle with complex coding challenges that involve both textual and visual components, such as code snippets, diagrams, or error messages. Our goal was to improve the AI's capability to interpret and generate high-quality coding responses, ultimately bridging the gap between human-like reasoning and automated assistance.

Methods, Approaches, and Tools Used

To achieve this, we leveraged LLaMA 2.0, a state-of-the-art large language model, and fine-tuned it using RLHF. Key steps in the approach included:

Data Curation: Selecting diverse and challenging coding-related images and prompts.

Prompt Engineering: Crafting intricate coding scenarios that test the model’s reasoning abilities.

Evaluation Metrics: Establishing benchmarks to assess model performance against human standards.

Model Fine-Tuning: Using reinforcement learning techniques to refine responses based on expert feedback.

Iterative Testing: Continuously improving subpar model responses to enhance accuracy and relevance.

We utilized PyTorch for model fine-tuning, Hugging Face's Transformers for integrating LLaMA 2.0, and various coding datasets to build a robust multimodal training pipeline.

Specific Tasks and Responsibilities

My primary responsibilities in this project included:

Designing and implementing a framework to evaluate AI-generated coding responses.

Developing and selecting high-quality coding-related prompts and images.

Reviewing model outputs and iterating on suboptimal responses to refine accuracy.

Contributing to RLHF training by guiding the reinforcement learning process with expert-annotated data.

Team Collaboration and Individual Contributions

This was a collaborative project, where I worked alongside a team of AI researchers, engineers, and data annotators. My role was pivotal in prompt engineering and response evaluation, ensuring the model's outputs met high-quality standards. I also played a key role in refining evaluation methodologies to make feedback loops more effective.

Outcomes and Impact

The project successfully enhanced LLaMA 2.0’s ability to handle coding-related multimodal tasks. Key outcomes included:

A more robust AI capable of understanding and generating coding solutions with visual and textual components.

Improved model accuracy in responding to complex programming scenarios.

Contribution to ongoing research in multimodal AI and RLHF, paving the way for future advancements in AI-assisted coding tools.
